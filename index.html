                    Hogwarts was built in a valley area — surrounding mountains were part of the landscape — with the fairly large Great Lake to thesouth of the main building. The huge main oak front doors that led into the Entrance Hall faced west, and opened up to slopinglawns. The deep Forbidden Forest extended around to the west of the castle. There were also exterior greenhouses and vegetablepatches on the school grounds.

                        <p>One of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Godric Gryffindor's house favoured students who were bold and brave. The wizard's legacy at Hogwarts was apparent in many ways, from his support of Muggle-born students attending the school to his portrait on the seventh floor, to the sword that appeared for any true Gryffindor in need of it. It was even rumoured to be Godric's own hat that was enchanted and used to sort incoming students. His home, the village that would come to be named Godric's Hollow, would be the home of several famous wizarding world characters, such as Bathilda Bagshot, the Dumbledores and The Potters.</p>

                        <p>A founder of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Rowena was known for her brilliant mind and love of learning. Her house encouraged these qualities in its students, and as a result, boasted some of the cleverest and highest achieving witches and wizards at the school. However, Rowena's history was mired in tragedy. Rowena's daughter Helena was murdered after stealing her mother's enchanted diadem and running away. Both Helena and her murderer, The Bloody Baron, haunted Hogwarts, representing Ravenclaw and Slytherin house respectively.</p>

                        <h2>Salazar Slytherin</h2>
                        <p>Salazar Slytherin was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and the least open to the idea of non-magical families sending their children to the school. Slytherin was a talented wizard, and skilled in Parseltongue and Legilimency, who favoured students in particular who showed signs of cunning and ambition. As he became more obsessed with the idea of magical purity, he grew away from his fellow founders and was eventually cast out of the school - but not before he was able to hide a dark secret within the walls of the castle. Salazar's dark legacy (and several of his possessions) would pass down his family, such as his locket and ring.</p>

                        <p>Helga Hufflepuff was a Welsh witch and was one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. While the other founders chose to have special students, she accepted them all, but the students of her house are described as loyal and hard-working. Helga's portrait remains at Hogwarts. Helga Hufflepuff was born in the 10th century and came from the broad valleys of Wales.[2] She was either born or married into the Hufflepuff family. Helga's greatest friend was Rowena Ravenclaw from the Scottish glens.</p>
